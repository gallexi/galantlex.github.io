I am a software developer, a sound designer, an amateur event organizer, and a dancer, and I have built this website to reflect those many sides. If you are a recruiter looking to potentially hire me as an engineer, check out my [Resume](/resume.pdf) or my [Projects](/projects) tab, where you'll find my recent work and links to fun things on my GitHub. If you are a theatre director or a musician looking for some audio production, shoot me a message! I'll be happy to provide a portfolio and more relevant resume. If you're a Boston area ballroom dancer and want to learn about Tufts Competition, visit [our website](https://sites.tufts.edu/ballroom/tufts-comp-2017/), and stay tuned for making-of blog posts, which will likely appear hereabouts. Finally, if you are just exploring, welcome to my website! It's a continual work in progress. I hope you enjoy your stay.
